        <article><p class="titulo">Warfare</p>
        <p>Viking warfare, along with its key component of raiding, is inextricably connected with the expansion of Scandinavian influence along the North Atlantic and into the Mediterranean in the Viking Age (c. 790-1100 CE), where the Vikings heavy use of ships, good strategic mobility and strong grasp on logistics ensured they could cause havoc abroad for years at a time. It was these factors that distinguish Viking warfare from that of their contemporaries; despite public imagination often picturing savage berserk-warriors frothing at the mouth and committing unspeakable brutalities to their unlucky targets, Viking warriors were probably no more brutal than their peers.</p></article>

        <article><p class="titulo">Combat & Tactics</p>
        <p>Like the rest of early medieval warfare in western Europe, Viking warfare could not simply ignore the effects of winter on campaigning and logistics. As such, it was generally a seasonal affair,increasingly in overwintering bases and settlements once they popped up in Viking-held territories abroad. From such settlements the Vikings could participate in local politics, tactfully choosing sides, reaching agreements with their enemies, securing the payment of tribute, and launching new campaigns.</p></article>
